We are going to start our journey in OS development by writing a small, bare-metal "Hello, World" application. 
* Project structure
Let's briefly describe the main components of this folder:
1. _Makefile_ : We will use the make utility to build the kernel. make's behavior is configured by a Makefile, which contains instructions on how to compile and link the source code.
2. _build.sh_ or _build.bat_ : You'll need these files if you want to build the kernel using Docker. You won't need to have the make utility or the compiler toolchain installed on your laptop.
3. _src_ : This folder contains all of the source code.
4. _include_ : All of the header files are placed here.
